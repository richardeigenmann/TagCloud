/**
 * A JPanel that grows vertically while maintaining the width of it's parent
 * JScrollpane. This class was created to work in conjunction with a JScrollPane
 * and FlowLayout. When adding components FlowLayout adds them to the right of
 * each other until the width is filled up. Then FlowLayout adds a line. This
 * class implements Scrollable as this allows us to trap the getPreferredSize
 * and grow the JPanel vertically to show the components. FlowLayout stops
 * horizontally because getScrollableTracksViewportWidth is defined to return
 * true;
